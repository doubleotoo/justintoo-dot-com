### Candidate Questions
After my friend, Jonathan, posed this question to me, I couldn't help but think about it.

I tried to conjure up a candidate question––not the most profound or the most all-encompassing––just some <em>worthwhile</em> question.

But I couldn’t do it. I mean, where would you even start? What <em>wouldn’t</em> you ask Jesus? 

<blockquote>

<p>Just how many stars are really out there, Jesus?</p>

<p>Is the moon made of cheese? Come on, be serious now.</p>

<p>Why do I have two hands; two feet; and two eyes? A dozen might have been handier.</p>

<p>24-hour days? In light of everything You call me to do...</p>

<p>Why did you invent homework? and those wretched chores?</p>

<p>Why do I own a Toyota instead of a Porsche?</p>

<p>Why are my ears so pointy; my feet so big; my hair such a mess?</p>

<p>Was it really necessary to create vegetables?</p>

<p>Why can’t I just be in Heaven with you already?</p>

</blockquote>

A whirlwind of questions was inside my mind, but none of those questions could satisfy my appetite for an answer. There was just something missing.

Something <em>artificial</em>.

Unable to give Jonathan an answer upfront really made me wonder. It bugged me for a while, but like everything else, I had to continue on my merry ole way.

### Psalm 8:3-9
Then, one day, God revealed it to me. And it was through <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%208:3-9&version=NIV'>Psalm 8</a>:

<blockquote>

<p>
3 When I consider your heavens,
the work of your fingers,
the moon and the stars,
which you have set in place,
4 what is mankind that you are mindful of them,
human beings that you care for them?
</p>

<p>
5 You have made them
and crowned them with glory and honor.
6 You made them rulers over the works of your hands;
you put everything under their feet:
7 all flocks and herds,
and the animals of the wild,
8 the birds in the sky,
and the fish in the sea,
all that swim the paths of the seas.
</p>

<p>
9 LORD, our Lord,
how majestic is your name in all the earth!
</p>

</blockquote>

### MercyMe - God With Us
And after reading <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%208:3-9&version=NIV'>Psalm 8:3-9</a>, this song started playing on <a href='http://www.klove.com/'>K-LOVE</a>:

For the next few minutes, I couldn't do anything except replay these lyrics from <a href='http://youtu.be/V8eOGhLzuVA'>MercyMe – God With Us</a>:

  <blockquote>
  Who are we, that You would be mindful of us?<br/>
  What do You see, that’s worth looking our way?<br/>
  We are free, in ways that we never should be.<br/>
  Sweet release, from the grip of these chains.<br/>
  …<br/>
  Lord You know, our hearts don’t deserve Your glory.<br/>
  Still You show, a love we cannot afford.
  </blockquote>

In light of the reading and in light of this video, I began to seriously ponder, once again, the question that Jonathan had posed to me just days earlier.

I closed my eyes and sort of chuckled to God...</em>

### Ah-ha!

That was it!

After reading <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%208:3-9&version=NIV'>Psalm 8:3-9</a> and watching <a href='http://youtu.be/V8eOGhLzuVA'>MercyMe - God With Us</a>, I got it! (Of course, this was after days of incessant mind-throbbing). But, still alive and well, and with great relief, I could give a peaceful sigh and say, <em>Jonathan, I got it</em>.

<em>Dude. I got it.</em>
