  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One response.</p>\n\n\
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would <em>you</em> ask Jesus?</p>\n\n\
  <h3 id=\"toc_0\">Candidate Questions</h3>\n\n\
  <p>After my friend, Jonathan, posed this question to me, I couldn&#39;t help but think about it.</p>\n\n\
  <p>I tried to conjure up a candidate question\xE2\x80\x93\xE2\x80\x93not the most profound or the most all-encompassing\xE2\x80\x93\xE2\x80\x93just some <em>worthwhile</em> question.</p>\n\n\
  <p>But I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t do it. I mean, where would you even start? What <em>wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t</em> you ask Jesus? </p>\n\n\
  <blockquote>\n\n\
  <p>Just how many stars are really out there, Jesus?</p>\n\n\
  <p>Is the moon made of cheese? Come on, be serious now.</p>\n\n\
  <p>Why do I have two hands; two feet; and two eyes? A dozen might have been handier.</p>\n\n\
  <p>24-hour days? In light of everything You call me to do...</p>\n\n\
  <p>Why did you invent homework? and those wretched chores?</p>\n\n\
  <p>Why do I own a Toyota instead of a Porsche?</p>\n\n\
  <p>Why are my ears so pointy; my feet so big; my hair such a mess?</p>\n\n\
  <p>Was it really necessary to create vegetables?</p>\n\n\
  <p>Why can\xE2\x80\x99t I just be in Heaven with you already?</p>\n\n\
  </blockquote>\n\n\
  <p>A whirlwind of questions was inside my mind, but none of those questions could satisfy my appetite for an answer. There was just something missing.</p>\n\n\
  <p>Something <em>artificial</em>.</p>\n\n\
  <p>Unable to give Jonathan an answer upfront really made me wonder. It bugged me for a while, but like everything else, I had to continue on my merry ole way.</p>\n\n\
  <h3 id=\"toc_1\">Psalm 8:3-9</h3>\n\n\
  <p>Then, one day, God revealed it to me. And it was through <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%208:3-9&version=NIV'>Psalm 8</a>:</p>\n\n\
  <blockquote>\n\n\
  <p>\n\
  3 When I consider your heavens,\n\
  the work of your fingers,\n\
  the moon and the stars,\n\
  which you have set in place,\n\
  4 what is mankind that you are mindful of them,\n\
  human beings that you care for them?\n\
  </p>\n\n\
  <p>\n\
  5 You have made them\n\
  and crowned them with glory and honor.\n\
  6 You made them rulers over the works of your hands;\n\
  you put everything under their feet:\n\
  7 all flocks and herds,\n\
  and the animals of the wild,\n\
  8 the birds in the sky,\n\
  and the fish in the sea,\n\
  all that swim the paths of the seas.\n\
  </p>\n\n\
  <p>\n\
  9 LORD, our Lord,\n\
  how majestic is your name in all the earth!\n\
  </p>\n\n\
  </blockquote>\n\n\
  <h3 id=\"toc_2\">MercyMe - God With Us</h3>\n\n\
  <p>And after reading <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%208:3-9&version=NIV'>Psalm 8:3-9</a>, this song started playing on <a href='http://www.klove.com/'>K-LOVE</a>:</p>\n\n\

  </center></p>\n\n\
  <p>For the next few minutes, I couldn&#39;t do anything except replay these lyrics from <a href='http://youtu.be/V8eOGhLzuVA'>MercyMe \xE2\x80\x93 God With Us</a>:</p>\n\n\
  <p><blockquote>\n  Who are we, that You would be mindful of us?<br/>\n  What do You see, that\xE2\x80\x99s worth looking our way?<br/>\n  We are free, in ways that we never should be.<br/>\n  Sweet release, from the grip of these chains.<br/>\n  \xE2\x80\xA6<br/>\n  Lord You know, our hearts don\xE2\x80\x99t deserve Your glory.<br/>\n  Still You show, a love we cannot afford.\n  </blockquote></p>\n\n\
  <p>In light of the reading and in light of this video, I began to seriously ponder, once again, the question that Jonathan had posed to me just days earlier.</p>\n\n\
  <p>I closed my eyes and sort of chuckled to God...</em></p>\n\n\
  <h3 id=\"toc_3\">Ah-ha!</h3>\n\n\
  <p>That was it!</p>\n\n\
  <p>After reading <a href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%208:3-9&version=NIV'>Psalm 8:3-9</a> and watching <a href='http://youtu.be/V8eOGhLzuVA'>MercyMe - God With Us</a>, I got it! (Of course, this was after days of incessant mind-throbbing). But, still alive and well, and with great relief, I could give a peaceful sigh and say, <em>Jonathan, I got it</em>.</p>\n\n\
  <p><em>Dude. I got it.</em></p>\n\n\
  <pre>\n\
  One question?\n\n  One response?\n\n    What would <em>I</em> ask Jesus?\n\n        Two simple words\xE2\x80\xA6\n\n\n            WHY ME?\n\
