  <p>Just a simple little advice for all
  <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/Resources/resources">RESTful</a> programmers out there. It&#39;s
  really simple, and cleans up your code quite a bit. A lot of Rails applications have two roles: an
  admin and non admin. Your code can get pretty ugly when implementing extra features for the admin.
  I&#39;m guessing everybody does this from time to time:</p>
  <pre><span class="Special">-</span> <span class="rubyControl">if</span> current_user.admin?
    <span class="Special">%</span><span class="Conditional">p</span><span class="Special">=</span> link_to(<span class="Identifier">@project</span>, <span class="Constant">:method</span> =&gt; <span class="Constant">:delete</span>)
  <span class="Comment">-# or this:</span>
  <span class="Special">%</span><span class="Conditional">p</span><span class="Special">=</span> link_to(<span class="Identifier">@project</span>, <span class="Constant">:method</span> =&gt; <span class="Constant">:delete</span>) <span class="rubyControl">if</span> current_user.admin?</pre>
  <p>It&#39;s no problem when you&#39;re doing this only once or twice, but as the project moves on, your views
  get swamped, and your controllers too! My suggestion is splitting it into multiple controllers, one
  for each role, like this:</p>
  <pre><span class="Type">ActionController</span>::<span class="Type">Routing</span>::<span class="Type">Routes</span>.draw <span class="rubyControl">do</span> |<span class="Identifier">map</span>|
    map.resources <span class="Constant">:projects</span>
    map.resource <span class="Constant">:admin</span> <span class="rubyControl">do</span> |<span class="Identifier">a</span>|
      a.resources <span class="Constant">:projects</span>, <span class="Constant">:controller</span> =&gt; <span class="rubyStringDelimiter">'</span><span class="String">admin_projects</span><span class="rubyStringDelimiter">'</span>
    <span class="rubyControl">end</span>
  <span class="rubyControl">end</span></pre>
  <p>This will generate these paths (amongst all usual others):</p>
  <pre>      project GET /projects/:id       { :action=>"show", :controller=>"projects"}
  admin_project GET /admin/projects/:id { :action=>"show", :controller=>"admin_projects"}
  </pre>
  <p>This way controllers and views stay clean and uncluttered. It has a cluttered <code>rake routes</code> as trade
  off though, but that&#39;s just a minor problem if you ask me. The admin controller can be used as
  administrator dashboard. If you have another solution, I&#39;d love to hear it!</p>
