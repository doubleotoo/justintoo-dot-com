  <p>I released an old Rails plugin as gem today. Slowly but surely, all my plugins will be converted to gems.</p>
  
  <p>This time it&#39;s an old one: <a href="http://github.com/iain/http_accept_language">http_accept_language</a></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Splits the http-header into languages specified by the user</li>
  <li>Returns empty array if header is illformed.</li>
  <li>Corrects case to xx-XX</li>
  <li>Sorted by priority given, as much as possible.</li>
  <li>Gives you the most important language</li>
  <li>Gives compatible languages</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>For more information, read the README on GitHub.</p>
