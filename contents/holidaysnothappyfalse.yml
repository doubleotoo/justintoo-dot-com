  <p>Well then: <strong>happy holidays!</strong> This x-mas, there have been a few nice Ruby presents, like
  the <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/merb">merging of Rails with Merb</a> and Github <a href="http://github.com/blog/277-pages-generator">has a shiny new
  feature</a> for creating project sites.</p>
  
  <p>I too will present you a Ruby x-mas present. It&#39;s a nice, but useless present, not totally out of
  line with the usual x-mas presents.</p>
  
  <p>It is a gem called <a href="http://iain.github.com/not"><strong>not</strong></a>. With not you can get rid of exclamation
  marks and the not keyword, and putting it later on in the sentence, thus making it better English.</p>
  
  <p>An example:</p>
  <pre><span class="Comment"># for core Ruby methods:</span>
  <span class="Identifier">@foo</span>.not.nil?
  <span class="Comment"># or any custom method:</span>
  <span class="Identifier">@user</span>.not.active?
  <span class="Identifier">@user</span>.not.save!</pre>
  <p>If you want it, you can install it as a gem:</p>
  <pre>sudo gem <span class="Statement">install</span> not</pre>
  <p>or as a Rails plugin:</p>
  <pre>./script/plugin <span class="Statement">install</span> git://github.com/iain/not.git</pre>
  <p>I hope you&#39;ll like it! <strong>Happy holidays!</strong></p>
  
  <h3 id="toc_0">Update</h3>
  
  <p>I moved the gem to <a href="http://gemcutter.org">gemcutter</a>. If you haven&#39;t tumbled yet, please do so, before installing my gem:</p>
  <pre>gem <span class="Statement">install</span> gemcutter
  gem tumble</pre>
