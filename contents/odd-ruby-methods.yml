  <p>I recently encountered some methods I didn&#39;t know about.</p>
  
  <h3 id="toc_0">~</h3>
  
  <p>The tilde method (<code>~</code>) is used by <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a> and you can use it like this:</p>
  <pre><span class="Keyword">class</span> <span class="Type">Post</span>
    <span class="PreProc">def</span> <span class="Function">~</span>
      <span class="Number">11</span>
    <span class="PreProc">end</span>
  <span class="Keyword">end</span>
  
  post = <span class="Type">Post</span>.new
  ~post <span class="Comment"># =&gt; 11</span></pre>
  <p>That&#39;s right: you call this method by placing the tilde <strong>before</strong> the object.</p>
  
  <p>In Sequel it is used to perform NOT queries, by defining the tilde on Symbol:</p>
  <pre><span class="Type">Post</span>.where(~<span class="Constant">:deleted_at</span> =&gt; <span class="Constant">nil</span>)
  <span class="Comment"># =&gt; SELECT * FROM posts WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL</span></pre>
  <h3 id="toc_1">-@</h3>
  
  <p>The minus-at (<code>-@</code>) method works just about the same as the tilde method. It is the method called
  when a minus-sign is placed <strong>before</strong> the object. In effect, this means that Fixnum is
  implemented somewhere along the lines of this:</p>
  <pre><span class="Keyword">class</span> <span class="Type">Fixnum</span>
    <span class="PreProc">def</span> <span class="Function">-@</span>
      <span class="Constant">self</span> * <span class="Number">-1</span>
    <span class="PreProc">end</span>
  <span class="Keyword">end</span>
  
  num = <span class="Number">10</span>
  negative = -num <span class="Comment"># =&gt; -10</span></pre>
  <p>I found this one browsing through the source of the
  <a href="http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_suppor%0At/duration.rb#L34-36"><code>ActiveSupport::Duration</code></a> class (you know, the one you get when you do <code>1.day</code>). I guess it makes
  sense.</p>
  
  <p>Be careful with chaining methods though:</p>
  <pre>ruby-1.9.1-p378 > num = 5
   => 5
  ruby-1.9.1-p378 > -num.to_s
  NoMethodError: undefined method `-@' for "5":String
    from (irb):5
    from /Users/iain/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.1-p378/bin/irb:17:in `<main>'
  </pre>
  <p>This also applies to the tilde method.</p>
  
  <h3 id="toc_2">So?</h3>
  
  <p>I don&#39;t know. Enrich your DSLs and APIs, if it makes any sense to do it.</p>
